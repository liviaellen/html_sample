The Company began trading on 30 June 2022. 2.Accounting policies  2.1 Basis of preparation of financial statements The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise specified within these accounting policies and in accordance with Section 1A of Financial Reporting Standard 102, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland and the Companies Act 2006. The following principal accounting policies have been applied:  2.2 Going concern At the time of approving the financial statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the forseeable future. Thus the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.  2.3 Foreign currency translation Functional and presentation currency The Company's functional and presentational currency is GBP. Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the spot exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. At each period end foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate. Non-monetary items measured at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction and non-monetary items measured at fair value are measured using the exchange rate when fair value was determined.  2.4 Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Tangible fixed assets are in the course of construction, therefore no depreciation has been charged. Depreciation will begin on completion of construction. Page 2",,,,,
