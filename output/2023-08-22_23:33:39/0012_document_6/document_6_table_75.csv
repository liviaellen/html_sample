Unnamed: 0,"Trade creditors are recognised initially at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the company does not have an unconditional right, at the end of the reporting period, to defer settlement of the creditor for at least twelve months after the reporting date. If there is an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting date, they are presented as non-current liabilities."
