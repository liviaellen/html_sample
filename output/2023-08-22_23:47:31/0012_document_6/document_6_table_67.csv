Unnamed: 0,"Turnover is stated net of VAT and trade discounts. Turnover from the sale of goods is recognised when the goods are completed. Turnover from the supply of services represents the value of services provided under contracts to the extent that there is a right to consideration and is recorded at the value of the consideration due. Where the contract has only been partially completed at the balance sheet date turnover represents the value of the service provided to date based on a proportion of the total contract value. Where payments are received from customers in advance of services provided, the amounts are recorded as deferred income and included as part of creditors due within one year."
